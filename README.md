This is where I am developing Applescripts to quickly set up commonly-used window configurations for classes and projects.

## TODO

-[ ] Make single class script with variables for particular folders/URLs/perspectives.
-[ ] Make hotkey combo to call class setups (separate keys for each class, or form field?)
