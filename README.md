This is where I am developing Applescripts to quickly set up commonly-used window configurations for classes and projects.

To set up to be accessed from FastScripts menu:

`ln set-up-project.scpt ~/Library/Scripts/`

## TODO

- [X] Make single script with variables for particular folders/URLs/perspectives.
- [X] Make hotkey combo to call class setups (separate keys for each class, or form field?)
- [] Make script to close all windows open in workspace
- [] Make work for multiple monitor configs
